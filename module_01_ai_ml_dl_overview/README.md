# Module 1: AI, ML, DL Overview & Introduction to Generative AI

## Overview

This module introduces the fundamental concepts of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, and provides a comprehensive introduction to Generative AI. You'll learn about the evolution of AI, understand key distinctions between different approaches, and explore real-world applications of generative models.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Define and distinguish between AI, ML, and DL
- Explain what Generative AI is and how it differs from traditional AI
- Identify real-world use cases of generative AI (ChatGPT, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)
- Understand different types of generative models (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Models, Transformers)
- Run basic ML and generative AI examples using Python
